# ECHOLESS_LOCATIONS 
This project seeks to explore the existence of secretive numbers station transmissions by casting a light upon the traces
of their shadowy origins within a more modern technological mode of enquiry - and with the aid of advanced
technological capabilities. This is essentially achieved through the integration of webcam capture and gesture detection using p5.js in order to reveal to the user various coded messages embedded within these strange transmissions.
